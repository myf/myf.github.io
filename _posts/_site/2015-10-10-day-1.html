<p>After a 24 hour long journey I finally made it to Shanghai. I was
welcomed by the border police with a special check up because they were
questioning a scratched entry page in my passport. I told them well that
was Nigeria, oh well.</p>

<p>My friend Zaiming had his dad come pick me up with their fancy car and
got me an entire apartment in central Shanghai. On the way there were 20
stories buildings, perhaps 10 in a row, in a very rural section near the
airport. It got me thinking about the reason behind it, perhaps the
developers were building it for a show, or that there are this huge of a
demand. The next few days I was bombarded by all the flashy colors and
lights of Shanghai. American bars that sells bacon beer with flamboyant
Americans; Japanese grill with the waitress tries to sell us everything;
Rooftop bars on the Bund that has red wine shipped directly from
Bordeaux. I find it that there’s something missing behind all these
colors and lights and noises, and I hope I can find out more by
venturing into the rural part of china.</p>

<p>My real journey started the next day when my cousin drove me and my bike
to the Province of Anhui in his bimmer. We went through yet many many
more buildings that are 20 stories high, all seems to be in the middle
of nowhere next to the highway. My tourmate Marian wanted to meet in
this “scenic area” called Marenshan, about 300km west of Shanghai since
“it’s what chinese people wanted to do”, according to her. On the small
road approaching to it I finally get to see rural China for the first
time: fields, farmers, water buffalo, all those in the romance. It still
exists outside of all the flashy buildings. Marenshan itself was a
really weird experience. It was supposed to be a geological park with
interestingly shaped rock formations. They tried to sell it by: building
a Mongolian Yurt as an restaurant; building a Mao’s button museum; hired
a village of Wa minority group from few thousand KM away to work as a
“primordial human life scene” event. Everything seems a little fake and
rootless.</p>

<p>The second day I built my bike in the parking lot of the vacation hotel
of Marenshan and started my journey! This was the first time I rode a
touring bike with all my luggage of the next two month on the side of
the back wheel. The steering is a bit funny. We biked on the small
coutry road where we came from earlier the day before, and ate at a
random food spot in the first town. Two other patrons start to pique
interest in Marian who is decidedly not chinese looking. She actually is
an expert in country side touring in china (this is her 5th or 6th tour)
so she casually started a conversation with them while I pretend to be a
foreigner. This is an interesting dynamic since we both can speak both
languages quite well. We rode along side of a semi polluted river. Met a
guy who’s tractor’s wheel fell off. Talked to an old guy sitting next to
a Taoist Temple. We went on a bigger road and it started to pour. Water,
mud, smog, pollution, dirt, whatever came down all together onto me
unexpectedly. After soaking wet and few more hours we came to a town
with a huge Kaifaqu (read, new planned town center). There was a church
on the side of the road but it wasn’t a church: it was a purposely built
wedding venue. We found lodging at a hotel, roughly 20 bucks us dollars.
Well, they did try to sell me one that costs 22 bucks but with sex toys
on the bed..</p>

<p>Next day I made yirgacheff coffee from my aeropress to start the day.
Couldn’t be better. We biked next to the Yangtze river. It was the first
time I saw the Yangtze river so I was kinda excited for this
significance. Although the river, though vast, is no more than a huge
muddy water. We biked next to the Anhui Greenway for about a mile, when
the greenway turned into a typical new wide road and we started to see
factories after factories on the side of the road. I couldn’t breath, my
eyes itches. I used my facemask and tried to squint my eye and go as
fast as possible to get out of this damned place. Tongling, the city
where we spent the night, means Copper Hill in Chinese. There are miles
after miles of copper factories that inherited the city’s name sake. But
it was awful. After about 2 hours we decide to take a detour to see an
ancient town. We saw another road side church, this time a real one
built in 1875, but it was a ruin, even the archaeological plaque was
smashed in halves. We went to the port, and hundred of farmers rushed to
the land with their dark green or grey clothing, with a bamboo stick on
the shoulder carrying very heavy load of vegetable to the market. Next
to the market is the marketed “ancient town”. They were rennovating it
by relaying the old stone road on cement. At the end of the day we took
a ferry across Yangtze to a little village that has only one hotel,
operated by the pair of lovely old couple. They told us about their
lives, their kids lives, their kids’ kids who are in Guangzhou and
recently got married. I was like, yes, this is what I want to see, after
all the crazy lights. This is the real china in the shadow, struggling.</p>
